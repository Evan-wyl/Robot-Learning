|      Open Cup      | The goal is to open the lid of a small condiment cup. Because of the cup’s small size, the grippers cannot grasp the body of the cup by just approaching it from the side. Therefore we leverage both grippers: the right fingers first lightly tap near the edge of the cup to tip it over, and then nudge it into the open left gripper. This nudging step requires high precision and closing the loop on visual perception. The left gripper then closes gently and lifts the cup off the table, followed by the right finger prying open the lid, which also requires precision to not miss the lid or damage the cup. |       |
|    Put On Shoe     | The goal is to put the shoe on a fixed manniquin foot, and secure it with the shoe’s velcro strap. The arms would first need to grasp the tongue and collar of the shoe respectively, lift it up and approach the foot. |       |
|     Prep Tape      | The goal is to hang a small segment of the tape on the edge of a cardboard box. The right gripper first grasps the tape and cuts it with the tape dispenser’s blade, and then hands the tape segment to the left gripper mid-air. Next, both arms approach the box, the left arm gently lays the tape segment on the box surface, and the right fingers push down on the tape to prevent slipping, followed by the left arm opening its gripper to release the tape. |       |
|    Slide Ziploc    | The right gripper needs to accurately grasp the slider of the ziploc bag and open it, with the left gripper securing the body of the bag. |       |
|    Slot Battery    | The right gripper needs to first place the battery into the slot of the remote controller, then using the tip of fingers to delicately push in the edge of the battery, until it is fully inserted. Because the spring inside the battery slot causes the remote controller to move in the opposite direction during insertion, the left gripper pushes down on the remote to keep it in place. |       |
|   Thread Velcro    | The goal is to insert one end of a velcro cable tie into the small loop attached to other end. The left gripper needs to first pick up the velcro tie from the table, followed by the right gripper pinching the tail of the tie in mid-air. Then, both arms coordinate to insert one end of the velcro tie into the other in mid-air. |       |
|   Transfer Cube    | The right arm needs to first pick up the red cube lying on the table, then place it inside the gripper of the other arm. |       |
| Bimanual Insertion | The left and right arms need to pick up the socket and peg respectively, and then insert in mid-air so the peg touches the “pins” inside the socket. |       |
